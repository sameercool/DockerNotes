The main work of webservice is to transfer the data from one application to the
another application.
-Distributed applications:SOA
considerations:
=Data types that are not compatible across different systems.
Means we do not know in which datatype the sender application will send and we do not
know which data type the receiver application will accept
=server loss
if there are two applications server and client, if server is down and the data
will not be sent to the client , we need to consider that also.
=client loss
if there is an network issue while data is being received by the client it comes
under client loss we need to consider that as well. 
=Retrying a call
when the data is not transferred from one application to another we need to make 
sure it is tried again.
=security
the data in between two applications should be sent securely.
=synchronous clocks between multiple computers:
The data should be sent from one application and should be received by the client
in synchronized manner.
------------------------------------------------------------
Synchronous function calls:
if we consider a messaging scenario where in we want to send 100 messages
-In synchronous it will send 1 message in a second and for 100 messages it will 
take 100 secs
-Asynchronous messaging
In asynchronous messaging multiple messages would be sent at a time
-------------------------------------------------------------
XML:(Extensible markup language)
It is an data exchange format, we are sending the data from one application and
receiving from other end. So the sender will give the output and the receiver will take 
the input/
=the main disadvantage of this is 
if we consider a bank application having various details like.
account number, name, mobile number, password and then the minimum balance....
-if there is error at minimum balance, we need to check the whole xml and see the
minimum balance and then it will show the error.
