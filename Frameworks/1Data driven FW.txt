Data driven frameworks:
In data driven frameworks we store the data in the property file and with the help of FIS we receive the data in test code
which is implemented to get the result.


------------------------
Why do we use data driven framework:
It is the part of functional testing wherin we test each and every component in the application with both valid and invalid data.
Since there would be so many components the testing data would be huge and the size would be more, 
it will become difficult to test the data that is the reason we  keep the data in excel sheet.

xpath for text():
//tag[text()='text']
