Hybrid framework:

Using frameworks leads to increased code reusability, higher portability, 
reduced cost of script maintenance, better code readability, etc. ... 
The Hybrid framework offers these advantages by functioning as a combination of both Keeyword and Data-Driven framework.

Use of hybrid framework:
Hybrid Driven framework is mostly used by manual testers who don't have much knowledge of programming languages. 
Such people can just have a look at the Keywords, Test data, 
Object repository and start creating the test case right away, without having to code anything in the framework
