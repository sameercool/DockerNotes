In normal script we write all the locators and actions in a single class.
Whereas in POM all the object locators are stored in a seperate class and the test methods are defined seperately.
Design principle:
Create seperate Object Repositery to store object locators.
-For each web page there should be seperate page class.
Eg:
If take an example of facebook website.
The pages in facebook are 
Webpage1- FbloginPage.java
webpage2- FbloginPage.java
The tests are
TestCase1- FbloginTest.java-TestBase.java

How to create POM classes in eclipse:
Go to File-> Go to New-> Others -> Maven Project to create a new Java project.
Step 2: Add the dependencies to pom.xml file.
Step 3: Create the packages. Create the packages under the src/main/java folder and the src/test/java folder 
and start writing the piece of code.
