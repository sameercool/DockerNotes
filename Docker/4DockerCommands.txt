life cycle of docker image or container life cycle 
step1:pulling
When we pull a particular image(helloworld,jenkins) from docker hub to your
hardware(laptop)
step2:image creation
-once you download the image from hub it willl be image creation.
Step3: running
-Container will only be created when you run a particular image in your cmd
Step4: commands
-Once container is created you can modify the container that is add, delete
 start and restart.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOCKER COMMANDS:

To know the version of your docker use the command
docker --version in cmd
-TO get the images go to dockerhub and search for image you want for your docker
2) To pull any image you need to use 
docker pull (image name)
-I want to pull ubuntu to my docker 
so run (docker pull ubuntu) in your cmd
-now the ubuntu image would be downloaded

3) NO OF IMAGES:
To see number of images created in your docker 
run the command 
(docker images)

4)NO OF CONTAINERS NOT RUNNING:
 To see number of containers running and not running we can see that using 
command

(docker ps -a)

5)COMMAND TO CREATE A DOCKER CONTAINER:
to create a container in docker the command is
(docker run -it -d (image name)
here it means interactive mode so that it could be present in background also
d means the deamon thread that means it should run even if the terminal is closed
EG:
(docker run -it -d ubuntu)
- you will get a id once you click enter that means container is created.

6)TO CHECK THE ACTIVE CONTAINERS:
 To check the up and running containers in the docker use command
(docker ps) it will show number of running containers


7)TO RESTART A CONTAINER:
to restart a container use the container name for eg:here for ubuntu the name is
distracted_ishizaka , use command
(docker restart distracted_ishizaka) and the container would be restarted.
-type again (docker ps -a) to get the time of restart of container

8)TO STOP A CONTAINER:
to stop a container us the name of the container
eg:
(docker stop distracted_ishizaka) 
-then use (docker ps -a) to know the status of the container
-it will show exit time

9)TO START A CONTAINER:
-To start a container use the name of container after docker
eg:
(docker start distracted_ishizaka)
-then use (docker ps -a) to know the status of the container


11)TO REMOVE A CONTAINER:
-To remove a container first we need to stop the docker because we cannot remove the
running docker.
-use (docker stop container ID)
eg:docker stop 4863727d1cde
-Once it is stopped now we can remove the docker the command to remove is
docker rm container ID
eg:(docker rm 4863727d1cde)

-use the command (docker ps -a) and see if the docker is removed or not

12)TO REMOVE AN IMAGE:
=To check the images in your docker use docker images
-When we remove a container the image will still be there the image can be removed
using the following syntax. 
(docker rmi imageID)
eg:
docker rmi feb5d9fea6a5
-let us again add the ubuntu using
(docker pull ubuntu)

13)TO FORCEFULLY STOP A RUNNING CONTAINER:
-The command used to forcefully stop the running container is
(docker kill containerID)
eg:docker kill a58dab4e677d

14)TO INSPECT CONTAINER:
To inspect a particular container the syntax is
(docker inspect containerID)
eg:docker inspect a58dab4e677d
-you will get a json file or source code

15)TO GET THE LIST OF IMAGES:
You can either use docker images command or you can use
(docker image ls)
to get all the images of docker
