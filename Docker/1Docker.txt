Docker is a devops tool designed to make easier to create,deploy,run and 
maintain applications using containers.
-If we consider a system which doesn't have docker.
-it needs to have a hardware and different os's also hyperwiser as a mediator between hardware
and os we can consider different os or containers as
-Jenkins, tomcat, sql server, mobile and BE
-The hyperwiser is very costly and it affects maintainance.
-Using docker will reduce the cost and affectiveness of system
-------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages of docker:
Docker uses independent containers or OS if we make change to one OS it will not
affect the other OS.
-If we consider normal system for example if RAM assigns 6gb to jenkins and if
jenkins uses only 4gb the other 2gb is wasted
-In docker if Ram assigns 6gb and if only 4gb is used docker will assign the
remaining memory to the another os or container let us consider Tomcat the 
remaining memory will be assigned to TOmcat.
------------------------------------------------------------------
If we consider an example of amazon server.
It will have Mssql, Be , s2 containers. If docker is not used if we make change
to one container it will affect the other containers too.
-If we use docker then if we make change to one container it will not affect the 
other container.
-----------------------------
Other advantages of Docker.
-Deploy services
-Maintain
-Add
-update
-Delete
------------------------------------
Use of docker in selenium or testing
if we consider different containers as mozilla , chrome , IE and mozila
maintainence ,cost will be more without docker.
-If we use docker it will maintain all the containers and one container will not
affect the other as every container is independent.
----------------------------------------------------
When not to use Docker:
docker shouldn't be used if there is an old existing framework/system and
making changes will affect the system.
