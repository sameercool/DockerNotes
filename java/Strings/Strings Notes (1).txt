String is basically an object that represents sequence of characters.


Strings are final classes in java,once created value cannot be changed.
Java String is immutable and final.

java string class provides some pre-defined methods to perform operations on string. 
some are- compare(), concat(), equals(),split(), length(), replace(), compareTo(), toString().


Creating a String

1)By String literal :
String is an object in Java. 

String s=“Welcome”;  

2)using new keyword:-

String str1 = new String("Welcome");
String str2 = new String("Welcome");

In this case compiler would create two different object in memory having the same string.
Java String is created by using a keyword “new”.
For example: String s=new String(“Welcome”);  




Difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes. StringBuffer operations are thread-safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder operations are not thread-safe.

StringBuffer is to be used when multiple threads are working on same String and StringBuilder in the single threaded environment.

StringBuilder performance is faster when compared to StringBuffer because of no overhead of synchronized.

equals()---boolean
-------------------
1)equals()
String str = "Hello Java";
System.out.println(str.equals("Hello Java"));//true
---
String str = "Hello Java";
System.out.println(str.equals("hello java"));//false

== --- boolean
-------------------
String s1 = new String("Football");
	String s2 = new String ("Football");
	String s3 = "Football";
	String s4 = "Football";
	
	System.out.println(s1==s2);//false
	System.out.println(s1==s3);//false
	System.out.println(s1==s4);//false
	System.out.println(s3==s4);//true


1)Write a java program reverse a string using recursion method?
2)Write a java program to check string is palindrome or not?
3)write a java program print duplicate characters from string?
4)write a java program to check two string are anagram of each other?
5)write a java program to remove duplicate character from the given string? 
6)write a java program find largest and smallest number in unsorted array?
7)write a java program to find repeated numbers in array?
8)write a java program to remove duplicate numbers in given array?
9)write a java program to find the missing numbers integer array of 1 to 100?
10)write a java program to find second largest element in an array of integers?
11)write a  java program to find index of an array element?
