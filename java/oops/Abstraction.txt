- Abstraction can achieve (0-100)
Rule1:
A method with no body is called as an abstract method.
eg: skeleton.
Rule2:
A method should always be declared as an abstract classs or if a class has a abstract method the class name should also be 
abstract.
Rule3:
If a class extends abstract class then the class should havee to implement all the abstract methods in parent class or it 
has to be declared abstract as well.
rule4:
Abstract methods in an abstract class are overridden inderived concrete classes otherwise we will get compile time error.
rule5:
In abstraction methods in an abstract class we cannot create an object for abstract class we can only create object reference.
