Interface:
Interface is used to get 100% security or data hiding.
-In an interface the abstract class should definitely have the abstract
method.
Uses interface:
1) It is used to achieve 100% data hiding.
2) It supports multiple inheritance.
3)We can achieve loose coupling. 
Rule1:
Interface class will be having public abstract method.
Rule2:
Like abstract interface method cannot have a body 
Rule3:
to declare variables compiler itself will give public static
even if we do not give variables insied interface.
- Interface allows multiple inheritance.
A B qualities in C it is called multiple inheritance.
