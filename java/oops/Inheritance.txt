Constructors:
-Constructor is used to access the Instance (variables inside the class) by creating an object.
1)default constructor
2)parameterized constructor
Rules:
-the name of the constructor should be same as class name.
-All the classes will have default constructor .
-If we do not declare a constructor java will automatically provide a default constructor.

Inheritance:
Inheritance in java is mechanism in which the child class will inherit the properties of parent class.
Advantages:
1 code reusability.
2 we can achieve polymorphism.
types:
1 single level
eg : A B -here B will inherit the features of A.
we only have single child and parent class.

2 multi level
eg A B C- here c and b will be having features of A.
3 multiple/hierarchy.
Eg:
A B C
if we want to have C the features of A and B
