POLYMORPHISM:
polymorphism in java means same task to be performed many ways.
Types:

-Method overloading.
2) Compile time polymorphism
-Method Overriding.
--------------------
Methodoverloading.
Rules:
- same class
- same name of the method
- different arguments.
-> no of arg
-> types of arg
-> sequence of args
-----------------------
Methodoverriding.
Rules:
- different class
- same name of the method
- same arguments.
-> no of arg
-> types of arg
-> sequence of args
-- here we follow inheritance.
-----------------------------------------
Methodoverriding when we create object only for child class we can only call child class and we cant access the parent class
To overcome this we use super Keyword.
