Test Suit in testNG
A test suite is a collection of test cases intended to test a behavior
or a set of behaviors of software program. In TestNG, we cannot define a 
suite in testing source code, but it is represented by one XML file, as 
suite is the feature of execution. It also allows flexible configuration of the tests to be run.

Test Priority in TestNG
Although TestNG annotations decide in which order the tests will run, priorities do more or less the same job.

The priorities are an additional option that we can put to use with the test annotations. This attribute decides 
the priority of the annotation. But remember that priority check happens after the annotation check by TestNG. So
 the TestNG annotation hierarchy is followed first and then priority-based execution. The larger the priority number, 
the lower is its priority. So a method with priority 1 will run after the test with priority 0.  A genuine question 
after learning this is, what if the priorities are the same for two methods? Let's see those.

TestNG Methods With Same Priorities
It might happen (intentionally or unintentionally) that the tester decides to provide the same priorities for different 
methods under TestNG annotations. In that case, TestNG runs the test cases in the alphabetical order. So the following test cases:
