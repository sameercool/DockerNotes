In a testNG class the order of executio of the test methods is based on the alphabetical orderor the
ascii value
=we can change the order of execution of the test cases depending upon the requirement using the concept 
of priorities.
SYNTAX:
@Test (priority= priority number)
priority number=1,2,3,4...
----------------------------------------------------
TestNG with same priority:
If multiple test cases having same priority the ascii value pf the method is compared
--------------------------------------
TestNG without priority:
Whenever test methods are given priorities and some of them are not, the test methods without priority
will get executed first
Note:
The methods with 0 priority will be assigned to 0 priority by default
