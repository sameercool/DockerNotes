Test NG is the upgrade of Junit.
TESTNG: TestNextGeneration
    -> What is TestNG?
        - TestNG is a UNIT TESTING TOOL.
        - It was inspired by JUNIT, but a little bit more advanced than JUNIT.
        - TESTNG helps us create certain testing flow/structure using 
        its ANNOTATIONS.
    TESTNG: TestNextGeneration
Annotations in testng
@test annotations:
This will include test annotations which are given in below 
order
1 @BeforeTest
2 @Test
3 @AfterTest
--------------------------------
@before method: this will be executed before every @test
annoted method.
@after method: this will be executed after every @test
annoted method.
@BeforeClass: This will be executed before first @Test method execution. It will be executed one only time throughout the test case.
@AfterClass: This will be executed after all test methods in the current class have been run
@BeforeTest: This will be executed before the first @Test annotated method. It can be executed multiple times before the test case.
@AfterTest: A method with this annotation will be executed when all @Test annotated methods complete the execution of those classes inside the <test> tag in the TestNG.xml file.
@BeforeSuite: It will run only once, before all tests in the suite are executed.
@AfterSuite: A method with this annotation will run once after the execution of all tests in the suite is complete.
@BeforeGroups: This method will run before the first test run of that specific group.
@AfterGroups: This method will run after all test methods of that group complete their execution.
